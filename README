script2app for macosx by sebastian volland

this script bundles a custom shell script into a standalone .app. you can then
put this standalone launcher.app into your /Applications folder and run it from
within spotlight or finder.

you can do the same with applescript, but applescript is slow, and that sucks.

requirements:

 * xcode (tested with xcode 4.0.2)

instructions:

 * first create your shell script, or edit myscript.sh
 * create launcher: ./script2app myscript.sh
 * this will produce launcher.app in the current directory.
 * move the app to your /Applications folder if you like:
   mv launcher.app /Applications/mylauncher.app
 * done.
